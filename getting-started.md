# Getting Started

## Registration

When you sign up to Example App you're asked to provide a team name. This is because we've designed Example App from the ground up 
to work well in a team environment - assets can all be accessed by team members, so no wheels need
reinventing.

## Adding Your First Client

It all kicks off in Example App when you add your first client. A *Client* in Example App is linked to an *Organisation* somewhere else.

After you register you'll be taken to the home page. This is where your team's clients will live once they've been imported from somewhere else.
